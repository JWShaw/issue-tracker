# Issue Tracker Project

For our term project in CPSC 300: Software Engineering, we decided to build a standalone web application with functionality similar to that of the on-board issue tracker in GitHub.

## Team Members

* [Jonathan Shaw](https://github.com/JWShaw)
* [Kai Lan](https://github.com/kai-lan)
* [Kelvan Johnson](https://github.com/Quintexial)
* [Sofia Jones](https://github.com/sofjones)

Our primary remote repository is hosted on-site at University of Northern British Columbia---as such, only major changes to the master branch will be pushed to the publically-available GitHub repository.

## Setting Up Development Environment

### Installing Dependencies

Initially, you will need to run `npm install` in three different directories:
* The project root directory
* The `backend` directory
* The `frontend` directory

### Running the project

* To run only the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and use `npm run dev`.
* To run only the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and use `npm run serve`
* To run both concurrently, use `npm run dev` from the project root directory.

By default, the backend runs on Port 3000 while the frontend runs on Port 8080.  To view the frontend in your browser, visit `localhost:8080`.
